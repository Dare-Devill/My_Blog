## Q1. Explain Head section of HTML with the help of suitable example.

The `<head>` section of an HTML document contains metadata and other information about the HTML document, but it is not displayed on the actual webpage. It typically includes elements like the document title, links to stylesheets or scripts, character encoding, and more. Here's an example of how the `<head>` section is structured:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Webpage</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- The content of the webpage goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the `<head>` section starts after the opening `<html>` tag and ends before the opening `<body>` tag. Here's a breakdown of the elements within the `<head>` section:

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, ensuring that the browser interprets text correctly.
- `<title>My Webpage</title>`: This sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`: This links an external CSS file (`styles.css`) to the HTML document, allowing you to apply styles to your webpage.
- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This includes an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) in the HTML document, enabling you to add interactive functionality to your webpage.

These are just a few examples of elements that can be included within the `<head>` section. You can add more elements as needed, such as additional `<link>` tags for different stylesheets or `<meta>` tags for various purposes like SEO or viewport configuration.

Remember that the `<head>` section is essential for providing information and instructions to the browser and search engines, but it doesn't directly affect the visible content of the webpage.

## Q2. Explain Body section of HTML with the help of suitable example. 

The `<body>` section of an HTML document contains the visible content that is displayed on a webpage. It includes elements such as text, images, headings, paragraphs, links, and more. Here's an example of how the `<body>` section is structured:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- The head section goes here -->
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Webpage of Pratham Mishra</h1>
  
  <p>Pratham Mishra is an aspiring web developer.</p>
  
  <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Pratham Mishra's Profile Picture">
  
  <a href="https://example.com">Click here</a> to visit Pratham Mishra's personal website.
  
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the `<body>` section starts after the opening `<body>` tag and ends before the closing `</body>` tag. Here's a breakdown of the elements within the `<body>` section:

- `<h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>`: This is a heading element that displays the main title of the webpage. The `<h1>` element represents the highest level of heading.
- `<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>`: This is a paragraph element that contains a block of text.
- `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">`: This is an image element that displays an image. The `src` attribute specifies the image source (URL or file path), and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image.
- `<a href="https://example.com">Click here</a> to visit Example.com.`: This is an anchor element (link) that creates a hyperlink to another webpage. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the destination page, and the text between the opening and closing `<a>` tags is the visible link text.
- `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This includes an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) in the HTML document, allowing you to add interactive functionality to your webpage.

These are just a few examples of elements that can be included within the `<body>` section. You can add more elements as needed to create the desired structure and content for your webpage. The elements within the `<body>` section define what is displayed on the actual webpage.


## Q3. Define Radio button and check boxes and differentiate between them.

**Radio Button:**

A radio button is a graphical user interface element that allows users to select one option from a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. It represents a single choice selection. Radio buttons are typically used when there is a need to present a list of options, and users are allowed to select only one option from the list.

Radio buttons are represented by circular or rounded buttons, accompanied by text labels. When a user selects a radio button, it becomes checked, and any previously selected radio button within the same group becomes unchecked automatically.

Here's an example of radio buttons:

```html
<form>
  <input type="radio" id="option1" name="radioOptions" value="option1">
  <label for="option1">Option 1</label><br>
  
  <input type="radio" id="option2" name="radioOptions" value="option2">
  <label for="option2">Option 2</label><br>
  
  <input type="radio" id="option3" name="radioOptions" value="option3">
  <label for="option3">Option 3</label><br>
</form>
```

In this example, three radio buttons are displayed with options "Option 1," "Option 2," and "Option 3." The `name` attribute is used to group the radio buttons together so that only one can be selected at a time.

**Checkboxes:**

Checkboxes, on the other hand, allow users to select one or more options from a set of choices. Unlike radio buttons, checkboxes are not mutually exclusive. Users can select multiple checkboxes simultaneously, indicating that they want to choose more than one option from the given set.

Checkboxes are represented by square or rounded boxes with a checkmark or X symbol inside. Each checkbox is associated with a specific option or feature, and users can toggle the checkboxes on and off as needed.

Here's an example of checkboxes:

```html
<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="option1" name="checkboxOptions" value="option1">
  <label for="option1">Option 1</label><br>
  
  <input type="checkbox" id="option2" name="checkboxOptions" value="option2">
  <label for="option2">Option 2</label><br>
  
  <input type="checkbox" id="option3" name="checkboxOptions" value="option3">
  <label for="option3">Option 3</label><br>
</form>
```

In this example, three checkboxes are displayed with options "Option 1," "Option 2," and "Option 3." The `name` attribute can be the same or different for each checkbox, depending on whether you want to group them or treat them individually.

To summarize, radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list, while checkboxes allow users to select multiple options simultaneously. Radio buttons are used for mutually exclusive choices, while checkboxes are used for non-exclusive or multiple selections.

## Q4. Explain Date object and Math object.

**Date Object:**

In JavaScript, the `Date` object is built-in and provides functionality for working with dates and times. It allows you to create, manipulate, and format dates. The `Date` object represents a specific moment in time and provides methods to retrieve and modify different aspects of a date, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.

Here's an example of how you can use the `Date` object to work with dates:

```javascript
// Create a new Date object
const currentDate = new Date();

// Get the current year
const year = currentDate.getFullYear();

// Get the current month (returns a zero-based value, so January is 0)
const month = currentDate.getMonth() + 1;

// Get the current day of the month
const day = currentDate.getDate();

// Get the current hour
const hour = currentDate.getHours();

// Get the current minute
const minute = currentDate.getMinutes();

// Get the current second
const second = currentDate.getSeconds();

// Display the current date and time
console.log(`Current date and time: ${year}-${month}-${day} ${hour}:${minute}:${second}`);
```

In this example, we create a new `Date` object using the `Date()` constructor without any parameters. Then, we use various methods provided by the `Date` object to retrieve the current year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. Finally, we display the current date and time in a specific format using `console.log()`.

The `Date` object offers numerous other methods, such as `setFullYear()`, `setMonth()`, `setDate()`, `setHours()`, `setMinutes()`, and more, allowing you to manipulate dates according to your requirements.

**Math Object:**

The `Math` object in JavaScript provides a set of mathematical operations and functions. It includes a collection of properties and methods for performing common mathematical tasks, such as arithmetic calculations, trigonometry, rounding numbers, generating random numbers, and more.

Here's an example that demonstrates some of the capabilities of the `Math` object:

```javascript
// Calculate the square root of a number
const number = 25;
const squareRoot = Math.sqrt(number);
console.log(`Square root of ${number} is ${squareRoot}`);

// Generate a random number between 1 and 10
const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log(`Random number between 1 and 10: ${randomNum}`);

// Round a number to the nearest integer
const decimalNum = 3.7;
const roundedNum = Math.round(decimalNum);
console.log(`Rounded number: ${roundedNum}`);
```

In this example, we utilize some common methods of the `Math` object. We calculate the square root of a number using `Math.sqrt()`, generate a random number between 1 and 10 using `Math.random()`, and round a decimal number to the nearest integer using `Math.round()`.

The `Math` object offers many other useful methods, including `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.abs()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.min()`, and various trigonometric functions like `Math.sin()`, `Math.cos()`, and `Math.tan()`, among others. These methods enable you to perform a wide range of mathematical operations within your JavaScript code.

## Q5. Describe CSS properties for absolute positioning of HTML elements.

To achieve absolute positioning of HTML elements using CSS, you can utilize the following properties:

1. `position`: Specifies the positioning type for an element.
   - `position: absolute;` - The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, or to the initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor. It is taken out of the normal document flow, and its position is determined by the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.

2. `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`: Specify the offset or distance of an absolutely positioned element from its containing block edges (top, right, bottom, left).
   - `top: 20px;` - Sets the distance between the top edge of the element and the top edge of its containing block.
   - `right: 30px;` - Sets the distance between the right edge of the element and the right edge of its containing block.
   - `bottom: 10px;` - Sets the distance between the bottom edge of the element and the bottom edge of its containing block.
   - `left: 50px;` - Sets the distance between the left edge of the element and the left edge of its containing block.

3. `z-index`: Determines the stacking order of overlapping elements with positioned or relatively positioned elements.
   - `z-index: 1;` - Specifies the stacking order of an element. Elements with higher `z-index` values appear in front of those with lower values.

By using these CSS properties, you can precisely position HTML elements on a web page. Here's an example of how these properties can be used:

```css
.absolute-positioned {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

In this example, the `absolute-positioned` class is applied to an HTML element. It will be positioned absolutely, 20 pixels from the top and 50 pixels from the left of its containing block. It will also have a `z-index` of 1, determining its stacking order among other elements.

Remember that when an element is positioned absolutely, it is taken out of the normal document flow, and other elements may fill the space it would have occupied.

## Q6. Explain In-line, Embedded and External style sheet. 

Here's an explanation of in-line, embedded, and external style sheets in HTML and CSS:

**Inline Styles:**
Inline styles are CSS styles applied directly to an individual HTML element using the `style` attribute. With inline styles, you can specify CSS properties and values within the HTML tag itself. Here's an example:

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with inline styles.</p>
```

In this example, the `<p>` element has inline styles defined using the `style` attribute. The styles `color: blue;` and `font-size: 16px;` will be applied only to this specific paragraph.

Inline styles have the highest specificity in CSS, which means they override any conflicting styles applied through external or embedded stylesheets. However, they can make the HTML code less maintainable and harder to manage if applied to multiple elements.

**Embedded Stylesheet:**
An embedded stylesheet, also known as an internal stylesheet, is CSS code placed within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. The styles defined within the `<style>` tags apply to the entire HTML document or a specific set of elements. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph with embedded styles.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `<style>` tags contain CSS rules that will be applied to all `<p>` elements in the document. The styles defined within the embedded stylesheet are specific to that HTML file.

Embedded stylesheets allow you to define styles for multiple elements in one place, making them more manageable than inline styles. However, they are limited to the specific HTML file and are not reusable across multiple web pages.

**External Stylesheet:**
An external stylesheet is a separate CSS file that contains styles for an entire website or multiple web pages. The external stylesheet is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph with external styles.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `styles.css` file contains CSS rules for styling HTML elements. The `<link>` element references the external stylesheet using the `href` attribute.

External stylesheets offer several advantages. They promote separation of concerns by keeping HTML and CSS code separate, making it easier to maintain and update styles across multiple web pages. Additionally, external stylesheets can be cached by the browser, improving the performance of subsequent page loads.

Overall, in-line, embedded, and external stylesheets provide different ways to apply styles to HTML elements. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the project and the desired level of maintainability and reusability.

## Q7. Explain DOM in detail.

**DOM (Document Object Model) in Detail:**

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API (Application Programming Interface) that represents the structure and content of HTML, XHTML, and XML documents as objects. It provides a programming interface for web developers to access, manipulate, and update the elements, attributes, and text within a document.

The DOM represents a web document as a hierarchical tree-like structure, known as the DOM tree. Here is a textual representation of the DOM structure:

```
document
└── html
    ├── head
    │   ├── title
    │   ├── meta
    │   └── ...
    └── body
        ├── div
        │   ├── h1
        │   ├── p
        │   └── ...
        ├── ul
        │   ├── li
        │   ├── li
        │   └── ...
        └── ...
```

- The `document` node represents the entire document.
- The `html` node represents the `<html>` element.
- The `head` node represents the `<head>` element, which contains meta-information about the document.
- The `title` node represents the `<title>` element, which specifies the document's title.
- The `meta` node represents the `<meta>` element, which provides metadata about the document.
- The `body` node represents the `<body>` element, which contains the visible content of the document.
- The `div` node represents a `<div>` element, a container for other elements.
- The `h1` node represents an `<h1>` element, which denotes a heading.
- The `p` node represents a `<p>` element, which denotes a paragraph.
- The `ul` node represents a `<ul>` element, which denotes an unordered list.
- The `li` nodes represent `<li>` elements, which denote list items.

This hierarchical representation reflects the nesting and structure of elements within the document.

The DOM allows developers to access, modify, and manipulate these nodes programmatically using scripting languages like JavaScript. Developers can traverse the DOM tree, find specific elements or attributes, modify their properties (e.g., changing attributes or content), and create new elements or nodes dynamically.

For example, using JavaScript, you can:

```javascript
// Accessing elements
const heading = document.querySelector('h1');
const paragraph = document.querySelector('p');

// Modifying content
heading.textContent = 'New Heading';
paragraph.style.color = 'blue';

// Creating new elements
const newElement = document.createElement('div');
newElement.textContent = 'New Element';
document.body.appendChild(newElement);
```

In this example, we access elements using selectors, modify their properties, and create a new `<div>` element dynamically.

The DOM provides a powerful interface for web developers to interact with and manipulate web documents, enabling dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Q8. Explain, how to create dynamic styles in HTML documents?

To create dynamic styles in HTML documents, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an explanation of how you can achieve dynamic styles:

1. **HTML Structure:** First, set up the HTML structure with the necessary elements and classes. For example, create a `<div>` element with an ID or class to target it in JavaScript.

```html
<div id="dynamicDiv"></div>
```

2. **CSS Styles:** Define the base styles in a CSS stylesheet or inline styles. These styles will serve as the starting point for dynamic changes.

```css
<style>
  #dynamicDiv {
    background-color: blue;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
  }
</style>
```

3. **JavaScript Interaction:** Use JavaScript to interact with the HTML elements and dynamically modify their styles.

```html
<script>
  // Get the element reference
  const dynamicDiv = document.getElementById('dynamicDiv');

  // Add event listener or trigger the style change
  dynamicDiv.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Modify the style dynamically
    dynamicDiv.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
    dynamicDiv.style.width = '300px';
    dynamicDiv.style.height = '300px';
  });
</script>
```

In the JavaScript code snippet above, an event listener is added to the `dynamicDiv` element, listening for a click event. Once the element is clicked, the style properties are modified dynamically using the `style` object. In this case, the background color, width, and height of the `dynamicDiv` element are changed.

You can customize the JavaScript code to suit your specific requirements, such as using different events or adding conditions for style changes based on user interactions or other factors.

By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can create dynamic styles in HTML documents that respond to user actions or other triggers, providing interactive and visually appealing web experiences.

## Q9. Explain switching flow and Loops used in PHP.

**Switching Flow and Loops in PHP:**

In PHP, you can use the `switch` statement for switching flow control and various types of loops to iterate over a set of instructions. Here's an explanation of the `switch` statement and different types of loops in PHP:

**1. Switch Statement:**
The `switch` statement allows you to select one of many blocks of code to be executed based on the value of a variable or an expression. It provides a way to simplify multiple conditional statements.

Here's the syntax of the `switch` statement:

```php
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    // more cases...
    default:
        // Code to be executed if expression does not match any case
}
```

Explanation:
- The `expression` is evaluated, and its value is compared with the values in the `case` statements.
- If a match is found, the code block corresponding to that `case` is executed.
- The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` block after executing a case.
- If no match is found, the code block within the `default` case is executed (optional).

Example:

```php
$day = 'Monday';

switch ($day) {
    case 'Monday':
        echo "Today is Monday";
        break;
    case 'Tuesday':
        echo "Today is Tuesday";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Today is neither Monday nor Tuesday";
}
```

Output:
```
Today is Monday
```

**2. Loops in PHP:**
Loops in PHP allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. PHP provides different types of loops:

- **`for` Loop:** The `for` loop is used when you know the exact number of iterations you want to perform.

```php
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}
```

Output:
```
01234
```

- **`while` Loop:** The `while` loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```php
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```php
$i = 0;

while ($i < 5) {
    echo $i;
    $i++;
}
```

Output:
```
01234
```

- **`do-while` Loop:** The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

```php
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

Example:

```php
$i = 0;

do {
    echo $i;
    $i++;
} while ($i < 5);
```

Output:
```
01234
```

- **`foreach` Loop:** The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over elements in an array or objects that implement the `Traversable` interface.

```php
foreach ($array as $value) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```php
$fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
    echo $fruit;
}
```

Output:
```
AppleBananaOrange
```

These are some of the commonly used flow

## Q10. Explain operators and expressions in PHP.

**Operators and Expressions in PHP:**

In PHP, operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands, while expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that produce a single value. Understanding operators and expressions is crucial for performing calculations, making comparisons, and manipulating data in PHP. Let's explore the different types of operators and expressions in PHP:

**1. Arithmetic Operators:**
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations. They include:
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulo (Remainder): `%`
- Exponentiation: `**`

Example:
```php
$a = 10;
$b = 5;

$sum = $a + $b;       // 15
$difference = $a - $b;  // 5
$product = $a * $b;   // 50
$quotient = $a / $b;  // 2
$remainder = $a % $b;  // 0
$power = $a ** $b;     // 100000
```

**2. Assignment Operators:**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They include:
- Assignment: `=`
- Addition assignment: `+=`
- Subtraction assignment: `-=`
- Multiplication assignment: `*=`
- Division assignment: `/=`
- Modulo assignment: `%=`

Example:
```php
$x = 10;
$y = 5;

$x += $y;   // $x is now 15
$x -= $y;   // $x is now 10
$x *= $y;   // $x is now 50
$x /= $y;   // $x is now 10
$x %= $y;   // $x is now 0
```

**3. Comparison Operators:**
Comparison operators are used to compare values. They include:
- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Identical to: `===`
- Not identical to: `!==`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

Example:
```php
$a = 5;
$b = 10;

$result1 = $a == $b;        // false
$result2 = $a != $b;        // true
$result3 = $a === $b;       // false
$result4 = $a !== $b;       // true
$result5 = $a > $b;         // false
$result6 = $a < $b;         // true
$result7 = $a >= $b;        // false
$result8 = $a <= $b;        // true
```

**4. Logical Operators:**
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations. They include:
- AND: `&&` or `and`
- OR: `||` or `or`
- NOT: `!` or `not`

Example:
```php
$a = true;
$b = false;

$result1 = $a && $b;    // false
$result2 = $a || $b;    // true
$result3 = !$a;        // false
```

**5. String Operators:**
String operators are used to manipulate strings. The main string operator is the concatenation operator (`.`), which combines two strings into one.

Example:
```php
$greeting = "Hello, ";
$name = "John";

$welcomeMessage = $greeting . $name;    // "Hello, John"
```

These are just

 a few examples of operators and expressions in PHP. Operators allow you to perform various operations, and expressions combine these operators with values and variables to produce results. By understanding and utilizing operators and expressions effectively, you can write powerful and dynamic PHP code.

## Q11. Write a function and call it with and without arguments.

Here's an example of a function in PHP that can be called with and without arguments:

```php
// Function definition
function greet($name = 'Friend') {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}

// Function call without arguments
greet();  // Output: Hello, Friend!

// Function call with an argument
greet('John');  // Output: Hello, John!
```

In the above example, we define a function called `greet()` that accepts one parameter `$name`. The parameter is set with a default value of `'Friend'`. Inside the function, we use the `echo` statement to display the greeting message.

When we call the `greet()` function without providing any argument, it uses the default value and outputs "Hello, Friend!" to the screen. However, when we call the function with an argument like `'John'`, it overrides the default value and outputs "Hello, John!" instead.

This allows the function to be flexible and adaptable to different scenarios. You can choose to provide an argument or rely on the default value based on your specific requirements.

## Q12. Explain array and its types.

**Array in PHP:**

In PHP, an array is a data structure that can hold multiple values of different types. It provides a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of related data. Arrays in PHP can be indexed or associative, and they offer various operations and functions for managing and accessing their elements.

**Indexed Arrays:**
Indexed arrays, also known as numeric arrays, are arrays where each element is assigned a numeric index starting from 0. The elements are stored in a sequential order, and you can access them using their corresponding index. Here's an example of an indexed array:

```php
$fruits = array('Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange');
```

In this example, `$fruits` is an indexed array that contains three elements. The index of 'Apple' is 0, 'Banana' is 1, and 'Orange' is 2. You can access individual elements using their index, such as `$fruits[0]` to get 'Apple'.

**Associative Arrays:**
Associative arrays, also known as key-value pairs, are arrays where each element is associated with a specific key or name. The key can be a string or a number, and it is used to access the corresponding value. Here's an example of an associative array:

```php
$person = array(
    'name' => 'John',
    'age' => 25,
    'city' => 'New York'
);
```

In this example, `$person` is an associative array that represents information about a person. The keys are 'name', 'age', and 'city', and the corresponding values are 'John', 25, and 'New York', respectively. You can access the values using their keys, such as `$person['name']` to get 'John'.

**Multidimensional Arrays:**
Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays as their elements. They allow you to create arrays within arrays, forming a hierarchical structure. This can be useful for storing complex data. Here's an example of a multidimensional array:

```php
$students = array(
    array('John', 20, 'Male'),
    array('Alice', 22, 'Female'),
    array('Mike', 19, 'Male')
);
```

In this example, `$students` is a multidimensional array that contains three arrays, each representing a student's information. Each student array consists of elements like name, age, and gender. You can access individual elements using both the outer and inner indices, such as `$students[0][1]` to get the age of the first student ('John').

These are the main types of arrays in PHP: indexed arrays, associative arrays, and multidimensional arrays. By utilizing arrays, you can store and manipulate collections of data efficiently in your PHP programs.

## Q13. Explain the creation of Database table.

To create a database table in PHP using MySQL, you need to establish a connection to the MySQL database and execute an SQL query to create the table. Here's an example of how you can create a database table in PHP with MySQL:

```php
// Step 1: Establish a connection to the MySQL database
$servername = "localhost";  // Replace with your MySQL server name
$username = "root";         // Replace with your MySQL username
$password = "password";     // Replace with your MySQL password
$dbname = "mydatabase";     // Replace with your database name

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Step 2: Define the SQL query to create the table
$sql = "CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    lastname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50),
    reg_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)";

// Step 3: Execute the SQL query
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Table 'customers' created successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Error creating table: " . $conn->error;
}

// Step 4: Close the database connection
$conn->close();
```

In the above example, we perform the following steps:

1. We establish a connection to the MySQL database using the `mysqli` class.

2. We define the SQL query to create the table. In this case, we create a table called "customers" with columns for id, firstname, lastname, email, and reg_date. The id column is defined as the primary key, and the reg_date column is set to automatically update with the current timestamp.

3. We execute the SQL query using the `query()` method of the database connection. If the query is successful, we display a success message. Otherwise, we display an error message.

4. We close the database connection using the `close()` method.

Make sure to replace the placeholders (e.g., servername, username, password, dbname) with your specific MySQL server and database credentials.

By running this PHP script, the database table "customers" will be created in your MySQL database, ready to store customer data with the specified columns.

## Q14. Explain the basic commands for database creation and connection with example.

Sure! Here are the basic commands for creating a database and establishing a connection in PHP with MySQL, along with examples:

1. **Database Creation Command:**

To create a database in MySQL, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` command. Here's an example:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";  // Replace with your MySQL server name
$username = "root";         // Replace with your MySQL username
$password = "password";     // Replace with your MySQL password

// Create a connection to the MySQL server
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

// Check the connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Create the database
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE mydatabase";
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Database created successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Error creating database: " . $conn->error;
}

// Close the connection
$conn->close();
?>
```

In the above example, we use the `CREATE DATABASE` command to create a database named "mydatabase". If the creation is successful, it will display the "Database created successfully." message. Otherwise, it will display an error message.

2. **Connection Establishment Command:**

To establish a connection with a specific database in PHP using MySQL, you can use the `mysqli` class. Here's an example:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";  // Replace with your MySQL server name
$username = "root";         // Replace with your MySQL username
$password = "password";     // Replace with your MySQL password
$dbname = "mydatabase";     // Replace with your database name

// Create a connection to the MySQL server
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check the connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Connection established successfully
echo "Connected to the database.";
?>
```

In the above example, we use the `mysqli` class to establish a connection with the MySQL server. We pass the servername, username, password, and dbname (the name of the database you want to connect to) as parameters to the `mysqli` constructor.

If the connection is successful, it will display the "Connected to the database." message. Otherwise, it will display an error message.

These examples demonstrate the basic commands for creating a database and establishing a connection in PHP with MySQL. You can modify the servername, username, password, and database name as per your specific MySQL configuration.
