<h2 id="q2-compare-orthographic-axonometric-and-oblique-projection">Q2. Compare Orthographic, Axonometric and oblique projection.</h2>
<p>Orthographic, axonometric, and oblique projections are different methods used in computer graphics and technical drawing to represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. Here&rsquo;s a comparison of these projection techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Orthographic Projection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthographic projection, also known as orthogonal projection or multiview projection, is a technique that represents an object by projecting it onto two or more perpendicular planes.</li>
<li>It is commonly used in technical drawing and engineering design to depict objects with precise measurements and dimensions.</li>
<li>In orthographic projection, the object is viewed from different directions, typically front, top, and side views, and each view is projected onto a separate plane.</li>
<li>The projected views show the object&rsquo;s true shape and size in each direction, but they lack depth perception.</li>
<li>Orthographic projection provides accurate and standardized representation, making it suitable for engineering and architectural drawings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Axonometric Projection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axonometric projection is a technique that represents three-dimensional objects by projecting them onto a plane at an angle.</li>
<li>Unlike orthographic projection, axonometric projection retains the object&rsquo;s proportions and allows for a sense of depth.</li>
<li>In axonometric projection, the object is rotated and projected onto a plane at a specific angle, typically 30°, 45°, or 60°.</li>
<li>The three most common types of axonometric projections are isometric, dimetric, and trimetric, depending on the angles used.</li>
<li>Axonometric projection provides a distorted but visually appealing representation, often used in architectural and interior design, as well as in video games for a stylized look.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oblique Projection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oblique projection is a technique that represents three-dimensional objects by projecting them onto a plane at an angle, similar to axonometric projection.</li>
<li>In oblique projection, the object is typically projected onto the plane by making one or more of its faces parallel to the plane of projection.</li>
<li>Unlike axonometric projection, oblique projection allows for different degrees of foreshortening, giving a more realistic representation of depth.</li>
<li>The most common type of oblique projection is cavalier projection, where one face of the object is parallel to the projection plane, resulting in no foreshortening in that direction.</li>
<li>Oblique projection is often used in technical drawing, furniture design, and illustration, as it provides a good compromise between accurate representation and visual appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, orthographic projection provides precise and standardized representations, axonometric projection offers a stylized and proportionate depiction, and oblique projection balances between accuracy and visual appeal. The choice of projection technique depends on the specific application and the desired representation style.</p>
<h2 id="q3-distinguish-one-point-two-point-and-three-point-perspective-projection">Q3. Distinguish one point, two point and three point perspective projection.</h2>
<p>One-point, two-point, and three-point perspective projections are techniques used in drawing and computer graphics to create the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality. Here&rsquo;s a comparison of these perspective projections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One-Point Perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-point perspective, also known as parallel perspective, is a technique where all lines converge to a single vanishing point on the horizon line.</li>
<li>It is used when the object or scene being represented has one set of parallel lines perpendicular to the viewer&rsquo;s line of sight.</li>
<li>In one-point perspective, objects appear to recede into the distance along a single direction, creating a sense of depth and space.</li>
<li>One-point perspective is commonly used to depict scenes with buildings or corridors viewed directly from the front or back.</li>
<li>It provides a simple and effective way to represent depth and is often used in architectural drawings and interior design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two-Point Perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-point perspective is a technique where the object or scene being represented has two sets of parallel lines that converge to two separate vanishing points on the horizon line.</li>
<li>It is used when the object or scene is viewed at an angle, showing two sides of the object or two different sets of parallel lines.</li>
<li>In two-point perspective, objects appear to recede into the distance along two different directions, creating a more dynamic and realistic sense of depth.</li>
<li>Two-point perspective is commonly used to depict scenes with buildings or objects viewed from a corner or with diagonal lines.</li>
<li>It allows for more complex compositions and is often used in architectural drawings, urban sketches, and interior design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three-Point Perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three-point perspective, also known as multi-point perspective, is a technique where the object or scene being represented has three sets of parallel lines that converge to three separate vanishing points on the horizon line.</li>
<li>It is used when the object or scene is viewed from an extreme angle or when there are multiple directions of receding lines.</li>
<li>In three-point perspective, objects appear to recede into the distance along three different directions, creating a highly dramatic and dynamic sense of depth.</li>
<li>Three-point perspective is often used to depict scenes with tall buildings, towering structures, or extreme foreshortening.</li>
<li>It provides a dramatic effect and is commonly used in concept art, architectural visualization, and fantasy illustrations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, one-point perspective is suitable for scenes with parallel lines perpendicular to the viewer&rsquo;s line of sight, two-point perspective is used for scenes with two sets of parallel lines, and three-point perspective is employed for scenes with three sets of parallel lines or extreme angles. Each perspective projection technique creates a different sense of depth and is chosen based on the desired visual effect and the characteristics of the scene being represented.</p>
<h2 id="q4-interpret-rgb-and-cmy-color-model">Q4. Interpret RGB and CMY color model.</h2>
<p>RGB and CMY are two color models used in computer graphics and digital imaging to represent and display colors. Here&rsquo;s an interpretation of both color models:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>RGB Color Model:</p>
<ul>
<li>RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, which are the primary additive colors used in the RGB color model.</li>
<li>In the RGB model, colors are created by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light. The three primary colors can be mixed together to create a wide range of colors.</li>
<li>Each color channel (red, green, and blue) has a value ranging from 0 to 255, representing the intensity of that color. A value of 0 means no contribution of that color, while 255 represents the maximum intensity.</li>
<li>By varying the intensity of each color channel, different colors can be achieved. For example, equal intensities of red, green, and blue (255, 255, 255) produce white, while zero intensities (0, 0, 0) result in black.</li>
<li>The RGB color model is widely used in electronic displays, such as computer monitors, televisions, and digital projectors. It is also the standard color model for creating and manipulating images in digital image editing software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CMY Color Model:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMY stands for Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow, which are the primary subtractive colors used in the CMY color model.</li>
<li>In the CMY model, colors are created by subtracting varying amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments from white light. The three primary colors can be mixed together to absorb different wavelengths of light, resulting in different colors.</li>
<li>In the CMY model, a combination of maximum intensities of all three colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow) results in black, while absence of all three colors yields white.</li>
<li>However, due to limitations in the subtractive mixing process, pure black is difficult to achieve using only cyan, magenta, and yellow inks. Therefore, in practical applications, a fourth color, black (K), is added to the model, resulting in the CMYK color model commonly used in printing.</li>
<li>The CMY color model is primarily used in printing processes, such as offset printing and inkjet printing, where inks of different colors are combined to create a full range of colors.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="q5-define-gouraud-and-phong-shading-in-detail">Q5. Define Gouraud and Phong shading in detail.</h2>
<p>Certainly! Here are detailed explanations of Gouraud shading and Phong shading, including mathematical formulas and diagrams:</p>
<p><strong>1. Gouraud Shading:</strong></p>
<p>Gouraud shading, also known as smooth shading, is an interpolation-based shading technique used to achieve smooth color transitions across the surface of a polygon.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lighting calculations are performed at each vertex of the polygon, taking into account the light sources, material properties, and the vertex&rsquo;s normal vector.</li>
<li>The shading values (typically RGB colors) obtained at the vertices are then interpolated across the surface of the polygon.</li>
<li>This interpolation is done using barycentric coordinates or other interpolation methods, resulting in smooth color gradients.</li>
<li>Finally, the computed shading values are assigned to individual pixels within the polygon to produce the shaded appearance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematical Formula:
The shading value at a specific pixel P within the polygon can be calculated by interpolating the shading values at the vertices V1, V2, and V3 of the polygon using barycentric coordinates:</p>
<p>Shading value at P = w1 * Shading value at V1 + w2 * Shading value at V2 + w3 * Shading value at V3</p>
<p>where w1, w2, and w3 are the barycentric coordinates of pixel P with respect to the vertices V1, V2, and V3.</p>

   V2       V3
</code></pre><p>In the diagram above, V1, V2, and V3 represent the vertices of a polygon. Gouraud shading calculates the shading values at these vertices and interpolates them across the polygon&rsquo;s interior, resulting in a smooth color gradient.</p>
<p><strong>2. Phong Shading:</strong></p>
<p>Phong shading, also known as per-pixel shading, is a more computationally intensive technique that calculates shading values for each pixel individually, resulting in more accurate shading and highlights.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vertex normals of the polygon are computed by averaging the normals of the polygon&rsquo;s vertices. These vertex normals represent the surface orientation at each vertex.</li>
<li>For each pixel on the polygon&rsquo;s surface, the normal vector is interpolated using barycentric coordinates or other interpolation methods.</li>
<li>Lighting calculations, including the reflection model, are performed at each pixel, taking into account the interpolated normal, light sources, and material properties.</li>
<li>Finally, the shading values (RGB colors) computed for each pixel are used to color the pixel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mathematical Formula:
The shading value at each pixel P on the polygon&rsquo;s surface can be calculated individually, taking into account the interpolated normal, light sources, and material properties. The reflection model, such as the Phong reflection model, can be used to calculate the shading value at P:</p>
<p>Shading value at P = Ambient term + Diffuse term + Specular term</p>
<p>where each term can be calculated using appropriate lighting and material properties.</p>
<p>Diagram:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>       V1

      /   \
     /_____\
   V2       V3
</code></pre><p>In the diagram above, V1, V2, and V3 represent the vertices of a polygon. Phong shading calculates the shading values at each pixel by interpolating the vertex normals and performing per-pixel lighting calculations, resulting in more accurate and detailed shading.</p>
<p>Both Gouraud shading and Phong shading aim to simulate the effects of light on surfaces, but they differ in the level of computational complexity and accuracy. Gouraud shading provides a smoother appearance at the expense of less precise shading at the pixel level, while Phong shading offers higher accuracy by computing shading values for each pixel individually. The choice between the two techniques depends on the specific requirements of the application and the</p>
<p>desired trade-off between visual quality and computational efficiency.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composition:</strong> The finalized drawings, colored frames, and backgrounds are combined to create the complete animation sequence. This step can involve photographing or scanning the frames and digitally assembling them using animation software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-Production:</strong> Additional effects, such as sound effects, music, and voiceovers, are added to the animation to enhance the final presentation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional animation requires skilled artists who excel in drawing, storytelling, and timing. It offers a distinct aesthetic with its handcrafted and artistic qualities. While the process of traditional animation is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it has a unique charm and has been the foundation for animation for many years.</p>
<p><strong>2D Animation:</strong></p>
<p>2D animation refers to the creation of animation using digital tools and software. It encompasses various techniques, including both traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI) that mimics the look of traditional animation.</p>
<p>In 2D animation, the animation process is done digitally, eliminating the need for physical drawing on paper or cels. The animator uses software to create and manipulate characters, backgrounds, and other elements. The process typically involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Storyboarding:</strong> Similar to traditional animation, a storyboard is created to plan the sequence of scenes and actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Drawing:</strong> Characters, objects, and backgrounds are drawn directly using digital tools, such as drawing tablets or vector-based software. The animator can use various tools and techniques to create and modify the artwork.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animation:</strong> The animator sets keyframes to define the major poses and movements in the animation. These keyframes are then interpolated to create smooth transitions between frames. The animator can adjust timing, spacing, and other parameters to achieve the desired motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coloring:</strong> Colors are applied digitally to the drawings. This can be done using paint tools within the software, allowing for easy modification and adjustment of colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backgrounds and Effects:</strong> Digital backgrounds and additional effects, such as shadows, lighting, and particle effects, can be created and integrated into the animation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compositing and Rendering:</strong> The individual elements, including characters, backgrounds, and effects, are combined and rendered to produce the final animation sequence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2D animation offers versatility in terms of artistic styles and can range from traditional hand-drawn aesthetics to clean and stylized vector-based graphics. It is widely used in various applications, including television shows, films</p>
<p>, advertisements, explainer videos, and interactive media. With the advancements in digital tools and software, 2D animation has become more accessible, allowing artists to create compelling animations efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="q13-illustrate-3d-animation-and-motion-animation">Q13. Illustrate 3D animation and motion animation.</h2>
<p>Certainly! Here&rsquo;s an illustration of 3D animation and motion animation:</p>
<p><strong>3D Animation:</strong>
3D animation involves creating animated content using three-dimensional computer graphics. It allows for the creation of realistic characters, objects, and environments in a virtual space. Here&rsquo;s an illustration of a 3D animated character:</p>
<p><img src="/img/3d_model.jpeg" alt="3D Animation"></p>
<p>In this illustration, you can see a 3D character model that has been rigged and animated. The character has volume, depth, and can be viewed from different angles. 3D animation offers a high level of detail, realism, and control over the movements and interactions of the animated elements.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Animation:</strong>
Motion animation refers to the technique of creating movement or animation through the manipulation of objects or characters frame by frame. It can be achieved using various methods, such as stop motion, claymation, or computer-generated motion graphics. Here&rsquo;s an illustration of a stop motion animation:</p>
<p><img src="/img/clay_fig.png" alt="Motion Animation"></p>
<p>In this illustration, you can see a sequence of frames showing the movement of a clay figure. Each frame captures a slight adjustment in the position of the figure, creating the illusion of movement when played back in sequence. Motion animation allows for creative storytelling and can be achieved using physical objects or digital techniques.</p>
<p>Both 3D animation and motion animation offer unique ways to bring characters, objects, and stories to life through movement. While 3D animation focuses on creating realistic and immersive environments, motion animation explores various techniques to capture movement in a visually captivating manner.</p>
